# How profitable is the XRP circular payment strategy?

Although it is possible to send XRP to yourself, from wallet A to wallet B (as long as you own both wallets), it is impossible to consume exciting offer(s) on the ledger by sending XRP from one wallet to another. In other words, an XRP-to-XRP transaction does not use any paths. 

However, it looks like rMHSvqV83BhFDhkQtXELxNYyyhq776dhzG managed to find a workaround/ way to send XRP to itself, while taking advantage of exciting offer(s) on the ledger, therefore taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
